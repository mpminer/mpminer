- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mpminer -- I most recently worked at Hootsuite.
- âœ¨ I have a lot of experience with Scala, PHP and Javascript (with some experience with React and Typescript), as those are the primary languages I've used over the last ~15 years. I'm "ok" at Java and have a little bit of experience with Go.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ruby on Rails and Python
